# Forecasting-Future-Water-Requirements-and-Acceessing-Water-Capacities-in-Dam
This project predicts Jayakwadi Dam water levels using BiLSTM and climate data. The model learns 30 days of past patterns to forecast 30, 60, and 90 days ahead. Results show accurate short-term prediction and stable long-term trends, supporting better water planning and management.
